version: 1
project: song-builder
overview: |
  Song Builder is a greenfield client-side web application for generating song lyrics and audio.
  Users iterate on lyrics via a chat interface backed by Claude (via Poe), then generate MP3 audio
  from those lyrics using ElevenLabs (also via Poe). A single POE_API_KEY gates all AI features.
  All data is persisted in localStorage — no backend is required. The app deploys to GitHub Pages
  via GitHub Actions, with build artifacts never committed to the main branch.

  The primary entity is a "lyrics entry" — a document with YAML frontmatter (title, style, commentary)
  and a lyrics body, plus an attached chat history. Songs are generated from a lyrics entry and stored
  alongside it. Deletions are always soft (a `deleted` flag), and nothing is ever hard-removed from storage.

  The stack is React + TypeScript + Vite, with shadcn/ui for components and Playwright for end-to-end
  and screenshot tests. Key architectural decisions: a single Poe API key covers both Claude and
  ElevenLabs; parallel song generation (N at a time, configurable); import/export of all localStorage
  data with an opt-in to include the API key. All LLM access is behind a typed LLMClient interface
  with a real (Poe) and a mock (fixture-based) implementation. Mock fixtures are pre-recorded real
  API responses produced by scripts/generate-fixtures.ts and committed to the repo. All tests and
  Playwright MCP QA always run against the mock client (VITE_USE_MOCK_LLM=true); no live API calls
  are made during testing.
goals:
  - Scaffold a production-ready React + TypeScript + Vite project with shadcn/ui and Playwright
  - Implement a typed localStorage data layer for lyrics entries, songs, and settings
  - Build the Lyrics Generator page with split-panel Claude chat and frontmatter display
  - Build the Song Generator page with parallel ElevenLabs audio generation and per-song actions
  - Build the Lyrics List page with search and soft-delete
  - Build the Pinned Songs page with play, unpin, and download actions
  - Build the Settings page with API key management and import/export
  - Implement the API key missing modal guard
  - Set up GitHub Actions for automated GitHub Pages deployment
nonGoals:
  - Any server-side or backend infrastructure
  - User authentication or accounts
  - Hard deletion of any data
  - Custom audio recording or editing
  - Lyrics versioning beyond the chat history

      As a developer, I want typed TypeScript interfaces, a localStorage service, and an import/export function, so that all data access is consistent and test infrastructure can seed state through the same code path users take when importing data.
    acceptanceCriteria:
      - "TypeScript interfaces defined for: Settings, LyricsEntry, Song"
      - Storage service exposes CRUD operations for each entity
      - "All soft-delete operations set `deleted: true` rather than removing the record"
      - A `storageService.import(json)` function accepts the same JSON format as the export and loads it into localStorage
      - A `storageService.export()` function serializes all localStorage data to JSON
      - Playwright tests cover round-trip read/write and import/export for each entity type
      - "All quality gates pass: `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npm run build`"
      - "Playwright MCP QA: agent uses Playwright MCP to simulate user flows and confirm the page renders and behaves correctly"

    description: |
      As a developer, I want a shared Playwright test infrastructure backed by the app's own import function, so that every feature story can seed realistic state and write tests without boilerplate. Tests MUST seed state by calling `storageService.import(fixture)` — the same function the Settings import UI calls — ensuring test state flows through the same code path as real users.
    acceptanceCriteria:
      - A `fixtures/` directory contains typed fixture data for LyricsEntry, Song, and Settings in the export JSON format
      - A `test/helpers/seed.ts` utility calls `storageService.import(fixture)` via `page.evaluate` to seed state before tests
      - A `test/helpers/screenshot.ts` utility seeds a fixture then captures a full-page screenshot
      - "`npm run screenshot:<page>` script pattern is wired up (scripts may no-op until pages exist)"
      - Playwright config targets the dev server with the correct base URL
      - A smoke test navigates to `/`, seeds empty state via the import function, and asserts the page loads
      - "All quality gates pass: `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npm run build`"
      - "Playwright MCP QA: agent uses Playwright MCP to simulate user flows and confirm the page renders and behaves correctly"

      As a developer, I want a typed LLMClient interface with interchangeable real (Poe) and mock implementations, so that the app runs fully offline during development and all tests — including Playwright MCP QA — never make live API calls.
      Design:
        src/lib/llm/
          types.ts            — LLMClient interface: chat() and generateSong()
          poe-client.ts       — PoeLLMClient: wraps OpenAI SDK with Poe baseURL and POE_API_KEY
          mock-client.ts      — MockLLMClient: reads from recorded fixture files, adds simulated delay
          factory.ts          — createLLMClient(): returns mock when VITE_USE_MOCK_LLM=true, else Poe
          fixtures/
            lyrics-response.txt   — recorded Claude response (valid frontmatter + lyrics body)
            song-response.json    — recorded ElevenLabs response { audioUrl: "..." }

      Fixture generation (run once by developer with a real API key):
        scripts/generate-fixtures.ts
          — reads POE_API_KEY from env
          — calls PoeLLMClient.chat() with a seed prompt ("write a short pop song about coffee")
          — calls PoeLLMClient.generateSong() with a matching style prompt
          — writes the raw responses to src/lib/llm/fixtures/
          — committed to the repo; MockLLMClient reads these files at runtime

        npm run generate:fixtures  →  npx tsx scripts/generate-fixtures.ts

      Switch mechanism:
        - VITE_USE_MOCK_LLM env var (true/false)
        - npm run dev:mock  →  VITE_USE_MOCK_LLM=true vite
        - npm run test      →  Playwright webServer sets VITE_USE_MOCK_LLM=true (no live API calls ever)
        - Playwright MCP QA runs against the same mock server
        - Production build (npm run build) never sets VITE_USE_MOCK_LLM; PoeLLMClient is used
    acceptanceCriteria:
      - "LLMClient interface is defined with `chat(messages): Promise<string>` and `generateSong(prompt): Promise<string>`"
      - PoeLLMClient implements LLMClient using the OpenAI SDK with Poe baseURL and dangerouslyAllowBrowser
      - MockLLMClient implements LLMClient, reads from fixture files, and adds a configurable simulated delay
      - createLLMClient() returns MockLLMClient when VITE_USE_MOCK_LLM=true, PoeLLMClient otherwise
      - "`scripts/generate-fixtures.ts` exists and, when run with POE_API_KEY set, writes fixture files to `src/lib/llm/fixtures/`"
      - "`npm run generate:fixtures` script is defined in package.json"
      - Fixture files (`lyrics-response.txt`, `song-response.json`) are committed to the repo
      - "`npm run dev:mock` starts the dev server with the mock client active"
      - Playwright webServer config sets VITE_USE_MOCK_LLM=true so all automated tests and Playwright MCP QA use the mock client
      - MockLLMClient fixture lyrics response is valid frontmatter (parseable title, style, commentary + body)
      - MockLLMClient fixture song response contains a usable audio URL
      - "All quality gates pass: `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npm run build`"
      - "Playwright MCP QA: agent uses Playwright MCP to simulate user flows and confirm the page renders and behaves correctly"

      As a user, I want to configure my API key and song count, and trigger import/export of all my data, so that I can manage the app's configuration and back up my work. The import/export logic lives in storageService (US-002); this story wires the UI to those functions.
    acceptanceCriteria:
      - POE_API_KEY input saves to localStorage on submit
      - numSongs input (default 3) saves to localStorage on submit
      - Export button calls storageService.export() and downloads the resulting JSON
      - '"Include API keys in export" checkbox controls whether POE_API_KEY appears in the export'

      As a user, I want a blocking modal to appear when I trigger generation without a POE_API_KEY, directing me to Settings, so that I understand what to do next. Note: in the mock client (VITE_USE_MOCK_LLM=true) this modal is still shown when POE_API_KEY is absent, keeping behaviour consistent between mock and real modes.
    acceptanceCriteria:
      - Modal appears when POE_API_KEY is absent and user submits a chat message
      - Modal appears when POE_API_KEY is absent and user triggers song generation
      - No API request is made while the modal is shown
