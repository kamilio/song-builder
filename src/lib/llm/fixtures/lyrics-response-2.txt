title: "Neon Rain"
style: "synthwave, cinematic, driving beat, 80s inspired"
commentary: "A moody synthwave track built around the image of neon reflections on rain-soaked city streets. The verses set an atmospheric scene while the chorus explodes into a driving, euphoric rush. Production should lean into gated reverb drums, pulsing basslines, and soaring analog leads."
duration: 165

**[Intro]**
*(synth arpeggio, distant sirens)*

**[Verse 1]**
Neon rain falls on the empty street
Echoes swallowed by the city beat
Headlights blur through the wet black glass
Every moment too electric to last

**[Pre-Chorus]**
Somewhere in the static glow
A frequency only we know

**[Chorus]**
Neon rain, neon rain
Washing out the noise and pain
We were made for nights like these
Electric hearts and neon dreams
Neon rain, fall again
On this city, on this lane
We're alive inside the haze
Burning bright through the rain-soaked maze

**[Verse 2]**
Shadows bleed through chrome and wire
The skyline hums its low desire
We move like ghosts through corridors of light
Two frequencies aligned on this electric night

**[Pre-Chorus]**
Somewhere in the static glow
A frequency only we know

**[Chorus]**
Neon rain, neon rain
Washing out the noise and pain
We were made for nights like these
Electric hearts and neon dreams
Neon rain, fall again
On this city, on this lane
We're alive inside the haze
Burning bright through the rain-soaked maze

**[Bridge]**
*(lead synth solo)*
The signal fades but never dies
It lives inside our open eyes
A city dreaming neon dreams
Nothing is quite what it seems

**[Chorus - Final]**
Neon rain, neon rain
Washing out the noise and pain
We were made for nights like these
Electric hearts and neon dreams
Neon rain, fall again
On this city, on this lane
We're alive inside the haze
Burning bright through the rain-soaked maze

**[Outro]**
Neon rain... *(echo fades)*
Neon rain...
